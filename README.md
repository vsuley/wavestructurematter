wavestructurematter
===================

The goal of this project is to provide a computational model to aid with testing the hypotheses within 'Wave Structure Matter' model

There will be two projects in the branch, at least to start with. 
- WSMLocal is the low cost rapid fire testing project where we'll code up formulae and test them from the console. Once proven here we will move them to the web project.
- Web will be the project which gets deployed on an AMI for actual use by people all over the world right from their web browsers.
